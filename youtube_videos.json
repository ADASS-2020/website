				"description": "Since 2008 Susanne Mertens is working on the experimental investigation of the elusive elementary particle, the Neutrino. With the two large-scale experiments, KATRIN and LEGEND, she explores their mass and the question of whether the neutrino is its own anti-particle. Beyond that, the group of Susanne Mertens is developing a novel detector system, to search for a new type of neutrino, the so-called sterile neutrino, which could make up a large part of the dark matter of our universe.\nNeutrinos: who are you and if yes how many?\n\nThe neutrino is a strange particle: it it extremely light and flies through matter without leaving a trace. Nevertheless --due to its vast abundance-- it plays a key role as cosmological architect in the formation of galaxies in our universe. One of the missing puzzle pieces for the exact understanding of the evolution of the universe is the mass of the neutrino. The discovery of neutrino oscillations, awarded with the Nobel prize in 2015, proofs that neutrinos are not massless, but does not reveal its actual value. The Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino (KATRIN) experiment aims at directly measuring the neutrino mass by investigating the radioactive decay of tritium with unprecedented precision. The talk will report on the mysterious neutrinos, how KATRIN will track down their mass, and which role computational methods play in the realization of such a large-scale experiment.\n\n    TU-Munich Susanne Mertens: https://www.ph.tum.de/about/people/vcard/8C819C16F9AF3575/?language=en\n    KATRIN and TRISTAN: Neutrinos and Dark Matter: https://www.mpp.mpg.de/forschung/astroteilchenphysik-und-kosmologie/katrin-und-tristan-neutrinos-und-dunkle-materie/\n\nRecorded at PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: pycon.de\nVideo editing: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan\nTools: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",

Michael is also a professor at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany, and a lecturer at the Data Science Academy.\nArtificial Intelligence: Differentiating Hype and Real Value\n\nStarting from the evolution of biological and artificial life and intelligence examples of already existing superhuman performance of \"narrow“ AI are presented. The history of artificial neural networks nicely shows how wrong human experts can be. Conditions for and principles of predictive and prescriptive analytics, two important working horses of AI, are presented. It is explained why superhuman performance is especially possible in mass decisions under uncertainty. Their value is proven with examples from largely improved and automated public scientific research as well as decision making in enterprises.\n\nA personal view about the role of python and some selected topics that will gain much more attention like causality extraction from historic data and discrimination-free algorithms are given, before concluding on how we should face the challenges but especially the chances of AI to create a better world. \n\nRecorded at PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: pycon.de\nVideo editing: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan\nTools: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",

				"description": "Daniel Jilg (@breakthesystem)\nI've been an app developer, a CTO, and a Python developer, mostly at the same time. I've carried through it all a desire to learn, a love for data visualisation, and a knack to pass on what I learned. I want to learn, I want to mentor, and I want to create inclusive spaces for people to learn and mentor themselves. In my free time, I open tins for my cats (who have their own instagram account), visit various spaceports around the world, and occasionally dabble in some motor sports.\n\nAbstract\n\nTags: complexity data structures algorithms space python\n\nThe N Body Problem is a computationally complex problem that we use to predict how planets and galaxies – and everything in between – move through space. I'll show you some interesting ways to calculate it, and we'll have a look at what to do, should you find yourself in a space ship's pilot seat.\nDescription\n\nThe N Body Problem is one of those famously hard to solve problems in computer science. It describes the movement and interactions of n bodies in space (where n is usually greater 3). You need a lot of computational power to passably approximate the gravitational influences a group of celestial bodies exert on each other. Can Python do that?\n\nI'll give a super brief overview of the history of trying to predict the motion of moon, sun and the visible stars, and then we'll dive deep into the original N Body Problem, followed by creative ways to reduce the amount of calculation needed and still get a reasonable approximation. Doing this, we can see how to tackle some complex mathematic and algorithmic problems easily using Python.\n\nIf you're a Python beginner or even very early in your career as a developer, you are going to get a first impression of efficient algorithms and complex data structures, and how to measure complexity using Big O notation. If you're more advanced, you'll be treated to a hopefully interesting way of implementing the Barnes-Hutt-algorithm, and some space nerdery.\n\nOnce we have all the pieces in place, let's play with some orbits. We'll see how orbits actually behave, as opposed to what the untrained mind would expect. We can use our new algorithms to try out some manoeuvres often used by real space craft and help you be prepared for when that call from ESA or NASA finally comes, and you'll be invited to work on Python In Space!\n\nRecorded at PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: pycon.de\nVideo editing: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan\nTools: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",

He previously worked as a quant for a hedge fund and as a data scientist for an e-commerce company. He has an honours degree in actuarial science and a MSc in statistics. He is one of the organizers of the Cape Town Deep Learning meet-up and has built numerous computer vision systems that run at scale in production predicting labels for millions of images per day.\n\nAbstract\n\nTags: business data-science use-case deep learning ai machine learning\n\nThe state-of-the-art in image classification has skyrocketed thanks to the development of deep convolutional neural networks and increases in the amount of data and computing power available to train them. The top-5 error rate in the ImageNet competition to predict which of 1000 classes an image belongs to has plummeted from 28% error in 2010 to just 2.25% in 2017 (human level error is around 5%).\n\nIn addition to being able to classify objects in images (including not hotdogs), deep learning can be used to automatically generate captions for images, convert photos into paintings, detect cancer in pathology slide images, and help self-driving cars ‘see’.\n\nThe talk will give an overview of the cutting edge and some of the core mathematical concepts and will also include a short code-first tutorial to show how easy it is to get started using deep learning for computer vision in python…\nDescription\n\nThis talk is a crash course on convolutional neural networks and how to use them to solve 2 real-world applications at scale. The first is an image moderation system and the second is a visual similarity system where a user uploads an image of an item and the system returns visually similar items.\n\nRecorded at PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: pycon.de\nVideo editing: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan\nTools: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",

At HelloFresh she is continuing to work with distributed technologies such has Apache Hadoop, Apache Kafka and Apache Spark to cope with the scalability that the fast growing company requires for dealing with their data.\n\nAbstract\n\nTags: data data-science pipeline\n\nThe challenge of data integration is real. The sheer amount of tools that exist to address this problem is proof that organizations struggle with it. This talk will discuss the inherent challenges of data integration, and show how it can be tackled using Python and Apache Airflow and Apache Spark.\nDescription\n\nThe way organizations analyze their data has evolved very quickly since the beginning of the millennium. The development of Hadoop, and the explosion in the variety of data that companies are dealing with nowadays, has fostered the appearance of the concept of data lake, and the shift of traditional ETL (extract, transform, load), to ELT (extract, load, transform). Yet, the challenge of integrating data to obtain valuable insights still remains, and despite the hype and attention being focused on data, very few organizations have actually managed to become data driven. In this talk I will present insights into how we are currently building data pipelines using Python (as a replacement to high level ETL software), Apache Airflow as a scheduler to our coded transformations, and Apache Spark for achieve scalability. Though building data pipelines is not the only element required to become data driven, it is a crucial one, and I hope to encourage the audience to use these open source technologies in their own ETL-ing (or ELT-ing) efforts.\n\nRecorded at PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: pycon.de\nVideo editing: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan\nTools: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",

				"description": "Uwe L. Korn (@xhochy)\n\nUwe Korn is a Data Scientist at the Karlsruhe-based RetailTec company Blue Yonder. His expertise is on building architectures for machine learning services that are scalably usable for multiple customers aiming at high service availability as well as rapid prototyping of solutions to evaluate the feasibility of his design decisions. As part of his work to provide an efficient data interchange he became a core committer to the Apache Parquet and Apache Arrow projects.\n\nAbstract\n\nTags: data-science hadoop apache arrow parquet pandas pydata\n\nWhile Python itself hosts a wide range of machine learning and data tools, other ecosystems like the Hadoop world also provide beneficial tools that can be either connected via Apache Parquet files or in memory using Arrow. This talks shows recent developments that allow interoperation at speed.\nDescription\n\nPython has a vast amount of libraries and tools in its machine learning and data analysis ecosystem. Although it is clearly in competition with R here about the leadership, the world that has sprung out of the Hadoop ecosystem has established itself in the space of data engineering and also tries to provide tools for distributed machine learning. As these stacks run in different environments and are mostly developed by distinct groups of people, using them together has been a pain. While Apache Parquet has already proven itself as the gold standard for the exchange of DataFrames serialized to files, Apache Arrow recently got traction as the in-memory format for DataFrame exchange between different ecosystems.\n\nThis talk will outline how Apache Parquet files can be used in Python and how they are structured to provide efficient DataFrame exchange. In addition to small code sample, this also includes an explanation of some interesting details of the file format. Additionally, the idea of Apache Arrow will be presented and taking Apache Spark (2.3) as an example to showcase how performance increases once DataFrames can be efficiently shared between Python and JVM processes.\n\nRecorded at PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: pycon.de \nVideo editing: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan \nTools: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",

				"description": "Raphael Michel (@rami)\n\nI‘m a software developer working with the web for more than ten years and with Python and Django for over four years. I work as a freelancer and maintain multiple open source projects. The most notable Django-based one is pretix, a full-featured and free conference ticketing software.\n\nAbstract\n\nTags: django python web\n\nThe power of some popular web applications like WordPress comes from a flexible plugin system. This talk will show how to implement such plugin architectures for Python web applications including real-world examples. I'll give examples with Django, but the important bits aren't Django-specific.\nDescription\n\nIt is probably common sense by now that modular architectures win over monolithic architectures in a number of ways. Django gives us reusable apps, but just because they are reusable doesn’t mean they automatically integrate nicely with each other and a Python programmer is still required to glue them together. In this talk I will show how to build a rich Django application that provides a well-defined plugin API. The API will allow plugins to seamlessly integrate with the main application. The talk will show various patterns around URL routing, Django‘s signal system and the use of setuptools to provide auto-detection of installed plugins. Installing a plugin should not be much more complicated than a simple pip install.\n\nDjango is only used as an example, most parts could be easily transferred to other web frameworks as well. The explained architecture has been in use for some years in the pretix open source project and made it possible to us to grow a rich plugin ecosystem.\n\n\nRecorded at PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: pycon.de\nVideo editing: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan\nTools: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",

Here, a data scientist needs to see the forest for the trees: The space of tools is best understood as an ecosystem, where libraries build upon each other, and where a good library fills an ecological niche by doing certain jobs well. This talk is a guided tour of the Python data science ecosystem. More than a list of libraries, it aims to provide some structure, classing tools by type of data, size of data, and type of analysis. In our tour, we visit a number of areas, including working with tabular data (numpy, pandas, dask, ...) and graph data (e.g. networkx), statistics (e.g. statsmodels), machine learning (scikit-learn, ...), data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn, bokeh, ...). Aspiring data scientists, and everyone else working with data, should find this useful for selecting the right tools for their next data-driven project.\n\nRecorded at PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: pycon.de\nVideo editing: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan\nTools: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",

				"description": "Dr. Hendrik Niemeyer (@hniemeye)\n\nData Scientist working on predictive analytics with data from pipeline inspection measurements.\n\nAbstract\n\nTags: data-science python machine learning ai\n\nIn this talk I will show how we use real and synthetic data to create successful models for risk assessing pipeline anomalies. The main focus is the estimation of the difference in the statistical properties of real and generated data by machine learning methods.\nDescription\n\nROSEN provides predictive analytics for pipelines by detecting and risk assessing anomalies from data gathered by inline inspection measurement devices. Due to budget reasons (pipelines need to be dug up to get acess) ground truth data for machine learning applications in this field are usually scarce, imbalanced and not available for all existing configurations of measurement devices. This creates the need for synthetic data (using FEM simulations and unsupervised learning algorithms) in order to be able to create successful models.\n\nBut a naive mixture of real-world and synthetic samples in a model does not necessarily yield to an increased predictive performance because of differences in the statistical distributions in feature space. I will show how we evaluate the use of synthetic data besides simple visual inspection. Manifold learning (e.g. TSNE) can be used to gain an insight whether real and generated data are inherently different.\nQuantitative approaches like classifiers trained to discriminate between these types of data provide a non visual insight whether a \"synthetic gap\" in the feature distributions exists.\n\nIf the synthetic data is useful for model building careful considerations have to be applied when constructing cross validation folds and test sets to prevent biased estimates of the model performance.\n\n\nRecorded at PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: pycon.de\nVideo editing: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan\nTools: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",

				"description": "Heidi Thorpe\n\nHeidi graduated with Honors in Chemistry from the University of Leeds before taking up a position as an Industrial Chemist with ICI (ORICA). This led to a career in software development working in UK, Aus and USA. In 2000 she became an author by the publication by Addison Wesley of Oracle8i tuning and administration: the essential reference ASIN: B007EIZGOG this was a sales success and translated into German. In her spare time she uses python to write software that allows her to train object classifiers to steal mens' mustaches and put them on the face of Taylor Swift. For this talk she will give a simple introduction to Generative Adversarial Networks using learned \"mustache-ness\" as an example, implemented with existing python modules\n\nPyconAu 2016 and PyconHK 2016 is her speaking experience https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70JAm03IBFI\n\nAbstract\n\nTags: python machine learning torch scikit-learn numpy neural networks\n\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of neural networks which are powerful and flexible tools. A common application is image generation. I would like to give a simple introduction to GANs using existing python modules and an example of how \"mustache-ness\" can be learned and applied.\nDescription\n\nThe objective is to showcase the power and flexibility of combining preexisting python modules and applying them to the field of image processing and machine learning. Learning what constitutes \"Mustache-ness\" in a straight forward and fun example of applying the technology in a 30 min presentation\n\nAttendees will learn tips on image processing, as well as training their own neural network.\n\nAn analogy can be considered as a relation between forger and detective. The task of the forger is to create fake examples of original paintings by famous artists. If the fake can pass as an original the the forger can exchange the fake for money. The task of the detective is to catch the forgers. He does this by knowing what are the properties that set the original artist apart and what sort of picture he would create. The detective uses this knowledge to determine whether or not the image is real or fake. From an introduction of what a Generative Adversarial Network is, how they work and how they can be used to generate fake images of mustaches by determining what constitutes \"mustache-ness\"\n\nYou will learn that there are two main components of a GAN – Generator Neural Network and Discriminator Neural Network.\n\nThe Generator Network takes an random input and tries to generate a sample of data.\n\nIt then generates data which is subsequently fed into a discriminator network D(x). The task of Discriminator Network is to take input either from the real data or from the generator and try to predict whether the input is real or generated.\n\nD(x) solves a binary classification problem using sigmoid function giving output in the range 0 to 1.\n\nYou will learn how to define the problem. Do you want to generate fake images or fake text. Having defined the problem you can then collect data for it. You will define how your GAN should look. In our example of \"mustache-ness\" you will choose a convolutional neural network.\n\nYou will see the effect of training the Discriminator on real data for n epochs. Using examples of real mustaches we will generate fake ones. We will see generated fake inputs for the generator and the effect of training the discriminator on fake data. The discriminator will correctly predict them as fake. Subsequently we will see how to train the generator with the output of discriminator. Now we can see a trained generator that can fool the discriminator. Generating fake mustaches that are indistinguishable from real.\n\nAttendees will learn tips on image processing, as well as training your own convolutional neural network.\n\nShowcasing the power of python in a fun, lighthearted way. Hopefully, being informative and entertaining\n\nRecorded at PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: pycon.de\nVideo editing: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan\nTools: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",

It’s plain, simple, modern, and atomic python.\n\nThis talk is a practical encounter, from zero to a complete data pipeline.\n\nSpoiler : no «big data» here.\nDescription\n\nSimple is better than complex, right? That’s true for data pipelines too.\n\nFor the last 5 years, I hacked together extract-transform-load (ETL) processes in various different positions (ETL is just a fancy term for «bunch of things that take data somewhere and put it elsewhere, eventually transformed»).\n\nI did it as a founder, as a consultant, as a technical co-founder, for some side projects, big corporates and small side projects.\n\nIn each case, I felt frustrated with the tools available, and in some serious cases, I had to hack things myself to get the job done. Bonobo is the repackaging of my past experiences for python 3.5+, and grasping the basics should not take more than the length of the presentation.\n\nOutline (subject to small changes, for the greater good) :\n\n    INTRO : The ETL market, why a new tool, what it is, what it is not.\n    Basics and concepts.\n    Simple example.\n    Complete data pipeline example, using SQL, RDF and a small Django frontend.\n    OUTRO : A glimpse at the future.\n    Q&A\n\nBonobo is the glue you need to tie together regular functions in a transformation graph (think unix pipes). Execution strategies are abstracted so you can focus on the real operations. As a result, you can engineer simple and testable systems, using the same good computer development practices as you use in .\n\n\nRecorded at PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: pycon.de\nVideo editing: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan\nTools: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",

By using Swarm64DB in combination with PostgreSQL, Python and the right scaling mechanism, we are able to push the ingestion throughput into areas where Python can easily compete with compiled languages. The talk highlights the architecture of our solution and showcases a real world use-case..\nDescription\n\nIn August 2016, a benchmark about asyncpg, a new PostgreSQL client library for Python was published. It highlighted ingestion speeds of up to 900k rows per second for a synthetic benchmark with a single byte per row. However, in realistic use-cases the ingestion speed is usually below that. Surprisingly it is not Python which is the limiting factor but rather the database itself. To make traditional RDBMS ready for Big Data, high performing OLAP and fast analysis on high speed data streams, Swarm64 created Swarm64DB, a hardware-accelerated plugin for PostgreSQL and other RDBMS.

He holds a PhD in physics, practices test-driven development, and digs Clean Code in C++ and Python. In the last five years, he invested more money in table tennis gear than in smartphones.\n\nAbstract\n\nTags: numpy database python data-science analytics\n\nPython's database API 2.0 is well suited for transactional database workflows, but not so much for column-heavy data science. This talk explains how the ODBC-based turbodbc database module extends this API with first-class, efficient support for familiar NumPy and Apache Arrow data structures.\nDescription\n\nThis talk introduces the open source Python database module turbodbc. It uses standard ODBC drivers to connect with virtually any database and is a viable (and often faster) alternative to \"native\" Python drivers.\n\nBriefly recounting the painful story of how data scientists previously used our analytics database, I explain why turbodbc was created and what distinguishes it from other ODBC modules. Sketching the flow of data from databases via drivers and Python modules to consumable Python objects, I motivate a few extensions to the standard database API 2.0 that turbodbc has made. These extensions heavily use NumPy arrays and Apache Arrow tables to provide data scientists with both familiar and efficient binary data structures they can further work on. I conclude my talk with benchmark results for a few databases.\n\n\nRecorded at PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: pycon.de\nVideo editing: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan\nTools: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",

He has been actively involved with technical communities for most of his career and likes to experiment with electronic devices in his mad scientist lab.\n\nAbstract\n\nTags: micropython python3\n\nIn this session you will get a gentle introduction to the ever-expanding world of small programmable devices: learn to use single board computers and microcontrollers to connect to sensors and talk to APIs - all using Python or MicroPython, a subset of Python 3 for use in constrained environments.\nDescription\n\nSmall single board computers such as the Raspberry Pi have made physical computing available to interested makers around the world. It is highly affordable, runs Linux and can be programmed using Python. But if all you want is to read a few sensors, the Pi's specs are overkill; and once your sensors are out in the field (sometimes even literally), power consumption suddenly becomes an issue. Many specialized devices with very low power requirements are available but historically you were constrained to using C to develop for them. Enter MicroPython, a subset of Python 3 designed for use on tiny devices with very limited resources.\n\nIn this session you will be introduced to the basics of physical computing and the joys (and some of the pains) of writing Python code for devices that weigh less than a piece of chewing gum but still have the power to communicate with web APIs, act as wireless access points, even host a small web server, and more.\n\nThe purpose of this session is to share some of the fun and excitement that can be had doing physical computing with Python. No prior experience with electronics is assumed or required.\n\n\nRecorded at PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: pycon.de\nVideo editing: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan\nTools: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",

In this role he screens for latest developments in these areas and evaluates and demonstrates their possible use and benefit for the company. Looking back to more than 20 years in using Python and Linux, he considers him to be an Open Source enthusiast and committed Python advocate.\n\nAbstract\n\nTags: use-case python business\n\nIntroducing a new programming language in a company is always a daring task, usually involving a lot of effort and the will for change.\n\nWe'd like to take you on a journey reflecting eight years of challenges, solutions and success ending in a best practice guide helping you to achieve the same.\nDescription\n\nROSEN is most recognized as a technology leader in the pipeline inspection business. To steadily achieve the best in class service for our customers, we are building and using the most sophisticated tools in the industry to perform the inspection services. This often results in very large volumes of data which have to be handled and analyzed.\n\nAs a consequence, we were always out to search for the latest technology and state of the art tools to aid us.\n\nAt a point where the most traditionally used tools for data analysis no longer scaled a handful of pioneers were brave enough to introduce a massive change in the scientific tool chain. This involved to address driving laboratory equipment, data processing, analysis and display, handling large volumes of data efficiently, building attractive graphical user interfaces, integrate with existing software applications and prepare for modern data analysis concepts based on machine learning to ensure both increasing result quality and faster data analysis.\n\nWe've found Python to be the ideal foundation to achieve all this and started off with a few initial projects in order to prove.

				"description": "Maximilian Wilhelm (@BarbarossaTM)\n\nBy day Maximilian Wilhelm is working as a Senior Infrastructure Architect in the central computing department of the University of Paderborn, by night he's hacking on the infrastructure of the Freifunk Hochstift network and some Open Source projects. Since the early 2000s he has a heart for Linux and Open Source, developed a weaknes for networking, IPv6 and routing a long while a go and has beed a speaker and tutor at the #Routingdays. Lately he got his hands dirty with ifupdown2, VXLAN, Linux VRFs, infrastructure automation with Salt Stack and \"kommunistischen Frickelnetzen\" and is afraid of SDNs ever since. In his spare time he likes playing piano and the organ, taking pictures of natures and cute animals, and trying to stay on the board while Windsurfing.\n\nAbstract\n\nTags: SDN SaltStack Linux Debian Networking devops use-case netops netdevops\n\nIn this talk you will get an overview about some awesome features of comtemporary Linux networking, how to easily integrate them with some cool open source tools, and glueing all this together with Salt Stack and some Python to get your very own SDN controller for a service-provider style network.\nDescription\n\nTopics like Infrastructure Automation / Orchestration, Cloud, and Software Defined Networks are on everyones tongue and nearly all network vendors who think highly of themselves provide products and maybe even solutions in this sphere of buzzwords.\n\nWithin the last years there has been a paradigm shift towards host and segment routing – think »IP Fabric« – as well as a focus on open protocols and standards like OSPF, IS-IS, BGP & MPLS not only in the data center. This even brought us some new standards like VXLAN and a bunch of open source based “open networking” platforms. Now we aren't always locked to the operating systems of a networking vendor but can choose the control plane software from a variety of Linux based solutions which can be managed and orchestrated by lots of different means.\n\nThanks to the Linux basis and the Open Source spirit of some vendors, some features (VRFs, MPLS forwarding plane, …) today are part of the upstream Linux kernel and available for everyone! Most notable are the contributions of the Debian Linux based platform from Cumulus Networks, which include the VRF support for Linux, some MPLS patches for FRR and ifupdown2 (which is written in Python :-)).\n\nPutting a bunch of these technologies and ideas together will open up a lot of powerful options for building low budget yet mighty networks. This talk will lay out how to build a SDN based service provide like infrastructure with the help of Salt Stack, some 1000 lines of Python and a bunch of affordable hardware where overlay networks and anycast aren't things to be scared of. The Freifunk Hochstift network and server infrastructure will be used as an example.\n\nThe target audience mainly consists of (Linux-) system and network engineers / architects, who already have some experience with the other world. A positive attitude towards automation and magic is a plus.\n\n\nRecorded at PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: pycon.de\nVideo editing: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan\nTools: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",

				"description": "Eberhard Hansis\n\nI have been writing code for more than two thirds of my life, mostly for scientific computing and data analysis. In the past couple of years, I have worked on a range of different data science projects, all using Python at their core. During this time, I repeatedly was tasked with making data usable by joining multiple sources into a clearly defined data model. Once you have done that, it is amazing how much real-life value you can generate with little more than a bit of statistics and visualization. The world is full of underused data, let’s change that!\n\nAbstract\n\nTags: data-science analytics python\n\nThere is no data science without ETL! This presentation is about implementing maintainable data integration for your projects. We will have a first look a ‘Ozelot’, a library based on Luigi and SQLAlchemy that helps you get started with building ETL pipelines.\nDescription\nETL, the hard way\n\nYou are starting a new data science project, and you can’t wait to perform some machine learning magic. However, before getting to ML, you have to deal with its ugly sibling: ETL. Extracting, transforming and loading data (or, more generally, data integration) is an indispensable first step in almost any data project.\n\nIn your project you will, most likely, have to extract data from various sources, clean it, link it and prepare it to your needs. You will start writing a first data integration script for some part of the process, then a second, then a third. At some point you will write an ugly ‘master’ script to keep your 17 import scripts in check and run them in just the right order. When you come back to the code later, you will have a hard time deciphering what you did and why, and what format the output data is in.\nPipelines to the rescue\n\nImplementing a proper data integration pipeline and a well-defined data model helps document your data flows and makes them traceable. More importantly, it simplifies the ETL development process, because it lets you easily re-run the whole process or parts of it. And you will have to modify and re-run your ETL, because your code changes, your output requirements change or the data changes.\n\nIn this talk I propose a setup for building maintainable data integration pipelines for everyday projects. This setup is embodied by ‘Ozelot’, my brand-new Python library for ETL. It is based on Luigi for pipeline management and SQLAlchemy as ORM layer. Ozelot gives you core functionality to quickly start building your own solution, including an ORM base class, database connection management and Luigi task classes that play nice with the ORM. It comes with extensively documented examples that walk you through various aspects of data integration.\n\nThe proposed setup works well for many small- to medium-sized projects -- projects, for which you previously might not have implemented a proper data integration pipeline. For big-data projects or those requiring live streaming data you probably want to consider alternative solutions.\nCore principles of data integration\n\nTaking one step back, I propose the following core principles for maintainable data integration:\n\n    Any and all data manipulation happens in the pipeline, in a single code base.\n    The pipeline represents all dependencies between data integration tasks.\n    Each task has a method for rolling back its operations.\n    Data is loaded into a single database, in a clearly defined, object-based data model that also encodes object relationships.\n    The whole process is fully automatic and thereby reproducible and traceable.\n\nI will discuss why I think that these principles are important, and how they are reflected in the proposed setup.\n\n\nRecorded at PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: pycon.de\nVideo editing: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan\nTools: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",

				"description": "Lauris Jullien (@herrbot_DE)\n\nI am a backend engineer @Yelp in Hamburg for 3 years. Before that I was working with robots @Aldebaran Robotics. And before that I was doing my own startup :) I like clean APIs, all you can do with data, and as a good French, wine.\n\nAbstract\n\nTags: use-case python web\n\nIt can be hard to test code that depends on external services. Often such services are mocked, but with time, it can be challenging to keep these mocks up to date. Verified fakes can solve this problem, and we will see how to set them up using OpenAPI and python.\nDescription\n\nWhen your code depends on an external (third-party) service, testing it can be challenging. It may be expensive, slow or unreliable to call that service in tests. A classic approach is to mock such service or its network calls. But then the challenge becomes keeping the mocks up to date with the third-party services. Using verified fakes allows us to replace a service while guaranteeing that it stays up to date. This can be achieved in different ways: using recent network recordings (e.g. vcrpy), running a test suite against the mock and the real service to compare the results, or relying on an API contract like OpenAPI, or avro.\n\nOpenAPI* is a specification that documents how a service API works and enforces it by validating requests and responses for the service. We can then check the mocks against the OpenAPI specification to make sure they are up to date.\n\nIn this talk, I will explain how to set up such verified fakes with OpenAPI, and present a new open-source library, pyramid_mock_server. Here are the 3 main focuses:\n\n    Quick introduction on OpenAPI and how to use it with bravado, the python OpenAPI client\n    How to set up Verified Fakes: using pyramid_mock_server\n    Usage @Yelp: usage of fakes and OpenAPI for unit tests, acceptance tests, and documentation\n\nThe talk focuses on OpenAPI, but the learnings and methodology can be extended to any other API specification languages (or python web frameworks).\n\n* The OpenAPI initiative is a cross-vendor consortium focused on creating, evolving and promoting a vendor neutral description format for APIs. As an open governance structure under the Linux Foundation, its members include Google, IBM, Atlassian and PayPal.\n\n\nRecorded at PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: pycon.de\nVideo editing: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan\nTools: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",

				"description": "The eye of the Python, an eye tracking system. From zero to... what eye learned.\n\nSamuel Muñoz Hidalgo | BEEVA\n\nI am Samuel (Samu for friends). With a curious mind I studied computer science, then focused in machine learning and IoT as a professional career. I haven't given up on my plan to take over the world; that's why my coworkers know a crazy idea is coming out, when I can't hide any longer a mischievous smile. I like to meet people and understand other points of view, and in return I like to show what I can do and teach what I have mastered. But, what drives me crazy is rollerskating with disco music.\n\nAbstract\n\nTags: data-science use-case python ai deep learning\n\nIs it possible to predict the point in the screen where a person is looking at? Easy to say but hard to do. An eye tracking system is the perfect project to learn the difficulties of applied machine learning. From gathering training data to building the final software with an acceptable performance.\nDescription\n\nIn this talk I will show how to build an eye tracking system from scratch.\n\nOnce the approach (machine learning) and the tools (Python ecosystem) are set, the important tasks are:\n\n    Making users addicted to a game built with Pygame in order to generate data.\n    Unleashing the power of deep learning over GPU with Tensorflow to train an Artificial Neural Network.\n    Exploiting the training model in real time so as to control a computer with the eyes with PyAutoGUI.\n\nThe path is full of pitfalls and every clear single step to the goal turns out to be a mountain of small but very important subtasks. Every iteration is a continuous struggle just to gain a bit of accuracy.\n\nDespite these efforts, at the very end we will see the difference between the theoretical and the real world. Our engineering skills will determine the usability of the new interface that allows us to move the mouse with our eyes; and we will learn that things don't need to be perfect, because humans are ...\n\n\nRecorded at PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: pycon.de\nVideo editing: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan\nTools: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",

				"description": "Time series feature extraction with tsfresh - “get rich or die overfitting”\n\nNils Braun (@_nilsbraun)\n\nCurrently I am doing my PhD in Particle Physics - which mainly involves development of software in a large collaboration. I love working with Python and C++ to process large amounts of data. Of course it needs to be processed as quickly as possible. I am working on the core reconstruction algorithms for our experiment, which are steered and controlled using Python. Apart from that, I was working as a Data Science Engineer for Blue Yonder, a leading machine learning company, where the idea for tsfresh was born. I am still heavily involved in the project. When I am not writing code, I am updating myself on the newest technical geek stuff (mostly cloud computing and deep learning) or play the guitar.\n\nAbstract\n\nTags: pydata time series data-science machine learning python ai\n\nHave you ever thought about developing a time series model to predict stock prices? Or do you consider log time series from the operation of cloud resources as being more compelling? In this case you really should consider using the time series feature extraction package tsfresh for your project.\nDescription\n\nTrends such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Industry 4.0, and precision medicine are driven by the availability of cheap sensors and advancing connectivity, which among others increases the availability of temporally annotated data. The resulting time series are the basis for manifold machine learning applications. Examples are the classification of hard drives into risk classes concerning specific defect, the log analysis of server farms for detecting intruders, or regression tasks like the prediction of the remaining lifespan of machinery. Tsfresh also allows to easily setup a machine learning pipeline that predicts stock prices, which we will demonstrate live during the presentation ;). The problem of extracting and selecting relevant features for classification or regression is these domains is especially hard to solve, if each label or regression target is associated with several time series and meta-information simultaneously – which is a common pattern in industrial applications. This talk introduces a distributed and parallel feature extraction and selection algorithm – the recently published Python library tsfresh. The fully automated extraction and importance selection does not only allow to reach better machine learning classification scores, but in combination with the speed of the package, also allows to incorporate tsfresh into automated AI-pipelines.\n\n\nRecorded at PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: pycon.de\nVideo editing: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan\nTools: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",

				"description": "Adrian Seyboldt\n\nI studied Mathematics and Bioinformatics in Bonn and Tübingen and I am a core developer of pymc3 since Feb 2017. Currently, I work for Quantopian on the development of Bayesian Methods for portfolio allocation.\n\nAbstract\n\nTags: python data-science machine learning analysis\n\nPyMC3 allows you to build statistical models for a wide range of datasets, use those models to estimate underlying parameters, and compute the uncertainty about those parameters. In this talk I will try to give a gentle introduction to PyMC3, and help avoid common pitfalls for new users.\nDescription\n\nSome of the problems that are discussed in the context of the reproducibility crisis in science and statistics can be solved or alleviated by tools like PyMC3 or Stan. They allow users to build much more realistic models and get a full distribution of the possible values for parameters as output – instead of p-values that are often hard to interpret correctly. Thanks to Hamiltonian and Variational methods, they are more flexible and can be applied to larger problems than predecessors like JAGS and BUGS. However, these new methods also come with challenges. Writing good models isn't easy, and when inference algorithms cry out in pain, they need someone who listens to them. This talk uses some real-world applications to give an introduction to PyMC3, without requiring a lot of background in math, statistics or programming.\n\n\nRecorded at PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: pycon.de\nVideo editing: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan\nTools: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",

Fear no more! This talk addresses how to identify code smell (from Brie to Bleu cheese) and go through examples to refactor code and APIs. You will learn the art of writing clean, maintainable and idiomatic Python code.\nDescription\n\nThis talk targets beginner software engineers yet also aims to provide interesting content for more advanced developers. You will leave knowing more about code smells and understanding the whys and hows of refactoring.\n\nCode smells refer to the symptoms of problematic code design. Identifying different types of code smells is the first step to successful refactoring. I will talk through some classic examples:\n\n    Unnecessarily complex code\n    Inappropriate naming\n    Duplicated code\n    Non-modularized code\n\nKnowing what to refactor, I will share a few learnings that lead to good quality code:\n\n    Good python practices (The Zen of Python & PEP8)\n    Good use of data structures (named tuples & sets)\n    The art of pythonic naming\n    DRY principle\n    Separation of concerns principle (modularity & encapsulation)\n\nRefactoring also makes testing easier. I will discuss how to write unit tests that cover all use cases. Finally I will talk about integration testing strategies that ensure that you and people who want to modify your API in the future are not breaking upstream code.\n\n\nRecorded at PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: pycon.de\nVideo editing: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan\nTools: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",

				"description": "Patrick Schemitz\n\nPatrick is a Senior Scientist at solute GmbH. An avid Pythonista since 2003, his main responsibility is the billiger.de search functionality, which he (co-) wrote using first Lucene, later Solr and now SolrCloud. Besides that, he wrote the SVM-based offer categorization at billiger.de and has a keen interest in machine learning. Patrick holds a Ph.D. in particle physics from Karlsruhe university.\n\nAbstract\n\nTags: solrcloud solr search python\n\nbilliger.de is a German price comparison site. Search is handled by a heavily customized Solr setup. When switching to SolrCloud earlier this year, instead of porting our custom SolrComponents to SolrCloud, we ended up re-implementing them in a Python service layer. Here we show how, and why.\nDescription\n\nThe search on our price comparison site billiger.de is implemented using Solr and half a dozen custom SolrComponents. When switching from Solr to SolrCloud earlier this year, we had to go over all our custom components in order to make them cluster-ready. What we ended up doing instead was re-implementing the custom functionality in a Python service layer that in turn uses stock SolrCloud. This talk describes our journey, shows some code and advocates hiding implementation details like Solr v. SolrCloud behind a service layer. Ported functionality includes boosting more successful documents, identifying brands and categories in queries, \"minimum match\" search and facet ranking and alternatives.\n\n\nRecorded at PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: pycon.de\nVideo editing: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan\nTools: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",

				"description": "Ami Tavory\n\nAmi is a data scientist at Facebook Research's Core Data Science group. He previously worked as a machine learning researcher in the fields of bioinformatics and algorithmic trading. In 2010 he received a Ph.D in Electrical Engineering from Tel Aviv University, in the field of financial information theory. His bachelor's and master's are from Tel Aviv University too.\n\nAmi uses Python and C++ for data analysis. He contributed to various open source projects, and is the author of a libstd C++ extension shipped with g++ (pb_ds: policy-based data structures).\n\nAbstract\n\nTags: code-introspection scikit-learn pandas data-science python machine learning\n\nScikit-Learn is built directly over numpy, Python's numerical array library. Pandas adds to numpy metadata and higher-level munging capabilities. This talk describes how to intelligently auto-wrap Scikit-Learn for creating a version that can leverage pandas's added features.\nDescription\n\nScikit-Learn is the de-facto standard Python library for general-purpose machine learning. It operates over NumPy, an efficient, but low-level, homogeneic array library. Pandas adds to NumPy metadata, heterogeneity, and higher-leve munging capabilities.\n\nIn the field of visualization, newer generation libraries, e.g., Seaborn and Bokeh, are providing safer, more readable, and higher-level functionality, by operating over Pandas data structures. Some of these are implemented using Matplotlib, a lower-level NumPy-based plotting library.\n\nThis talk describes a library for a Pandas-based version of sickit-learn. Here, too, giving a Pandas interface to a machine-learning library, provides code which is safer to use, more readable, and allows direct integration with Pandas's higher-level munging capabilities.\n\nDue to the large-scale, and evolving nature, of sicikit-learn's codebase, it is infeasible to manually wrap it. Except for a small number of intentional deviations from sickit-learn, the library wraps Scikit-Learn modules lazily through module and class introspection, and dynamic module loading.\n\nFollowing a short review of the relevant points of Pandas and Scikit-Learn, the talk is roughly divided into two aspects:\n\n    Scikit-Learn And Pandas User Perspective\n        Safety Advantages Of Pandas-Based Estimators\n        Using Metadata For Inter-Instance Aggregated Features And Cross-Validation\n        Using Metadata For Advanced Meta-Algorithms: Stacking, Nested Labeled And Stratified Cross-Valdiation\n    Python Develop Perspective\n        Unique Challenges Of Scikit-Learn Introspection And Decoration\n        Two Approaches For Wrapping Scikit-Learn Estimators\n        Lazy Dynamic Module Loading\n\nRecorded at PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: pycon.de \nVideo editing: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan \nTools: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",

Before joining ETH Zurich, he was an autonomous driving researcher at Mercedes-Benz Research in Silicon Valley and a graduate student at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.\n\nDavid is a firm believer in open source and is organising Germany's largest deep learning meetup series, and Silicon Valley's self-driving AI series. He is a contributor to popular machine intelligence frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch and speaks chinese with swabian accent.\n\nAbstract\n\nTags: deep learning ai machine learning python autonomous-driving pytorch\n\nModern neural networks have hundreds of layers! How can we train such deep networks? Simply stacking layers on top doesn't work! This talk introduces the deep learning library PyTorch by explaining the exciting math, cool ideas and simple code behind what makes really deep neural networks work.\nDescription\n\nModern neural networks consist of hundreds of computation layers! These very deep architectures consistently outperform shallower networks in a variety of tasks. However just simply stacking layers on top of each other won't work because the gradients are either vanishing or exploding during optimisation procedure. This talk explains the exciting math, cool ideas and elegant code that modern neural network architectures such as ResNets, HighwayNets and DenseNets are applying to circumvent the problem using PyTorch. PyTorch is a relatively new deep learning framework that is deeply integrated into Python. Unlike other frameworks such as TensorFlow and Theano, it uses tape-based automatic differentiation to run computation immediately, supports dynamic neural networks and provides a powerful GPU-accelerated Tensor library. The talk concludes with some real-world use-cases for very deep neural networks in chemical-genetic profiling and autonomous driving.\n\nRecorded at PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: pycon.de \nVideo editing: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan \nTools: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",

I've worked and continue to work on our Business Owner App backend and am deeply involved in the service infrastructure at Yelp. My main focus area is inter-service development. I'm one of the maintainers of the Python stack for Swagger / OpenAPI (bravado etc). I also work on developer productivity, such as making integration and end-to-end testing faster and more reliable.\n\nAbstract\n\nTags: python\n\nYou have an existing codebase of tens or hundreds of thousands of lines of Python code? Learn how to get started with type annotations! Get your teammates (and yourself!) to always annotate your code. Find out what unexpected issues you might run into and how to solve them, all with this talk.\nDescription\n\nYou've heard about type annotations, you know they help reduce bugs and improve documentation especially for large codebases, and you've attended an introductory talk or read a tutorial about using them. But how do you get started using them with your big, existing codebase? How do you make sure your colleagues will be annotating new code they write - or existing code they're changing? And how do you get around some of the issues you might run into when using the still-beta type checker mypy on your codebase?\n\nThis talk will start where the typical introductory Python type annotation talks end and discuss the real-world challenges when starting to annotate types with an existing codebase of tens or hundreds of thousands of lines of code. I'll walk you through best practices learned from doing just that at Yelp, telling you about some of the roadblocks we hit (and how we got past them). We'll also take a look at:\n\n    how you can get the most out of type annotations even with non-annotated third-party libraries\n    how to deal with decorators and other things that currently don't work well with annotations\n    when the only way to get proper type checking is through refactoring your code.\n\nRecorded at PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: pycon.de\nVideo editing: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan\nTools: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",

				"description": "Christian Theune (@theuni)\n\nAbstract\n\nTags: python devops\n\nPython's versatility is known to admins - in this talk I'd like to show how it fits for many small and big challenges I meet regularly: from tiny scripts to large systems. Also, I'll show how using the languages' advanced and/or newer features makes scripts more compact and robust.\nDescription\n\nDRAFT Unfortunately I got sick just a few days before the CFP date, so hopefully you can live with a draft description for now. I'll be happy to update this during or after the review as needed.\n\nI'd like to give a hands-on approach for how to use Python in a mixed environment where you may be writing very small standalone scripts, small integration programs and/or larger systems. As an admin bash is always a very close friend and one quickly uses it and then ends up with large scripts that should never have seen the day of light. Also, admins nowadays might be writing larger software bases that are actual software projects and the lines between \"ops\" and \"devs\" are - on purpose - more and more blurry. However, there are some differences in \"application development\" and \"system development\". Those are more of a mindset issue, however, and Python as a technology fits in both situations quite well and allows one to transition between those modes rather seamlessly.\n\nI'll be reviewing specific pieces of code from our infrastructure, ranging from smaller scripts to subsystems to a full-born Pyramid application that we use for inventory management. All of those will use different versions of Python, different libraries and different approaches how to solve certain problems. I will likely show how not to do things as well.\n\nRecorded at PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: pycon.de \nVideo editing: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan \nTools: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",

				"description": "Flow is in the Air: Best Practices of Building Analytical Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow\n\nDominik Benz (@john_maverick)\n\nDominik Benz holds a PhD from the University of Kassel in the field of Data Mining on the Social Web. Since 2012 he is working as a Big Data Engineer at Inovex GmbH. In this time, he was involved in several projects concerned with establishing analytical data platforms in various companies. He is most experienced in tools around the Hadoop Ecosystem like Apache Hive and Spark, and has hands-on experience with productionizing analytical applications.\n\nAbstract\n\nTags: workflow data pipeline data-science analytics\n\nApache Airflow is an Open-Source python project which facilitates an intuitive programmatic definition of analytical data pipelines. Based on 2+ years of productive experience, we summarize its core concepts, detail on lessons learned and set it in context with the Big Data Analytics Ecosystem.\nDescription\nMotivation & Outline\n\nCreating, orchestrating and running multiple data processing or analysis steps may cover a substantial portion of a Data Engineer and Data Scientist business. A widely adopted notion for this process is a \"data pipeline\" - which consists mainly of a set of \"operators\" which perform a particular action on data, with the possibility to specify dependencies among those. Real-Life examples may include:\n\n    Importing several files with different formats into a Hadoop platform, perform data cleansing, and training a machine learning model on the result\n    perform feature extraction on a given dataset, apply an existing deep learning model to it, and write the results in the backend of a microservice\n\nApache Airflow is an open-source Python project developed by AirBnB which facilitates the programmatic definition of such pipelines. Features which differentiate Airflow from similar projects like Apache Oozie, Luigi or Azkaban include (i) its pluggable architecture with several extension points (ii) the programmatic approach of \"workflow is code\" and (iii) its tight relationship with the the Python as well as the Big Data Analytics Ecosystem. Based on several years of productive usage, we briefly summarize the core concepts of Airflow, and detail in-depth on lessons learned and best practices from our experience. These include hints for getting efficient quickly with Airflow, approaches to structure workflows, integrating it in an enterprise landscape, writing plugins and extentions, and maintaining it in productive environment. We conclude with a comparison with other analytical workflow engines and summarize why we have chosen Airflow.\nQuestions answered by this talk\n\n    What are the core concepts of Apache Airflow?\n    How can Airflow help me with moving data pipelines from analytics to production?\n    Which concepts of Airflow make it more slim and more efficient compared to Apache Oozie?\n    How can I specify dynamic dependencies at runtime between my analytical data processing steps?\n    Which facilities does Airflow offer to enable automation and orchestration of analytical tasks?\n    How can I extend the built-in facilities of Airflow by writing Python plugins?\n\nPeople who benefit most from this talk\n\n    Data Scientists who are looking for a slim library to automate and control their data processing steps\n    Data Engineers who want to save time debugging static workflow definitions (e.g. in XML)\n    Project leaders interested in tools which lower the burden of moving from analytics to production\n    Hadoop Cluster administrators eager to save cluster resources\n\nRecorded at PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: pycon.de \nVideo editing: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan \nTools: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",

Now you could check out your code and install the dependencies manually but that seems like a lot of wasted time, right? Shouldn't there be a more convenient way of doing this?\n\nYes! And it's easier than you think! In this talk you'll learn how to build a Continuous Delivery pipeline for your python (or whatever) projects in 30 Minutes.\n\nIn the beginning you'll get a quick introduction into the topic and the used tools, which are open source and free to use. For those who know a little about the subject: We will use conda (https://conda.io) to build the software package and for the dependency handling. GitLab.com will process the actual pipeline for us and Anaconda.com serves us with a package distribution channel.\n\nAfter that it's \"hands on\" time. We will go step by step trough the process. Starting with the creation of a little dummy program. Then extending the dummy in such manner that it can be build into a package. Afterwards we will create the pipeline and finally do a demo deploy. And if the gods of conference internet are merciful, you see all this as a live demonstration.",

Python hides a lot of peculiarities very well, but for the sake of this talk we will try to uncover them.\n\nI will be explaining how the whole process of tokenizing - parsing - ast creation - bytecode works and will use odd Python code to give you an insight on the internals. Do you think ++4; is valid Python? Or how about 0jif.1else-2? There are no spaces in it. Go figure! \"Edge cases\" will help us understand the inner workings of Python. These two cases are possible, because of the tokenizer. Other \"weird\" Python code is waiting as soon as you start looking at the grammar file. Have you for example heard about lambda generators?\n\nWe will be looking into how modules, classes and instances are really just fancy dictionaries and how importing is really nothing else than storing a module into a dictionary (sys.modules).\n\nThere are a lot of things we can learn from diving deep into the details of our beloved languages. This talk will give you a very small introduction in how languages are built and explain how Python itself is defined by its parser, tokenizer and bytecode generation. Knowing how those abstractions work makes you a better Python programmer, because you will know better how the language behaves.",

The hardware hacking team of TNG Technology Consulting has built a telepresence robotics system based on a Nao robot, an Oculus Rift and a Kinect One. Using these components you can realize an immersive \"out-of-body experience\" - similar to that of the film \"Avatar\".\n\nThis talk shows how easy it is to program the robot using Python. We will do this by some live coding examples. Following a live demonstration of the showcase we will guide you through the complete program flow of the telepresence system. The speakers will share some insights about the challenges they faced during its implementation. The history of telepresence robotics, current trends and examples for real world fields of application will also be focused.",
