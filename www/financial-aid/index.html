            <p>
              As part of our commitment to the Python community, we are pleased to announce that we offer special grants
              for people in need of a financial aid to attend EuroPython. Please follow the instructions below to apply
              for a grant.
            </p>

            <h4>How I can I do to support?</h4>
            <p>
                We offer financial aid conference grants in these 3 categories:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Ticket</b>: Get a standard ticket for the conference for free</li>
                <li><b>Tracel costs</b>: We will cover the travel costs pro rata, depending on what you are applying for</li>
                <li><b>Accommodation</b>: You can get partial refund for the accommodation</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
              Note: the social event is NOT included in the EuroPython 2018 conference tickets. You will have to
              purchase separate tickets if you want to attend the social event.
            </p>

              <h4>Grant Eligibility</h4>
              <p>
                EuroPython is the a wonderful place to meet and share your experience for Python developers from Europe
                and all around the word. Our goal is support people which want to make Python community better:
                conference speakers and tutorial presenters, active people from small Python communities and open source
                contributors.

                Our grants are open to all people in need of financial aid. We will specifically take into account the
                following criteria in the selection process:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Contributors</b>: potential speakers/trainers of EuroPython (people who submitted a proposal) and all
                  who contribute to EuroPython and/or Python community projects.</li>
                <li><b>Economic & social factors</b>: we want everybody to have a chance to come to EuroPython, regardless of economic
                  situation or income level.</li>
                <li><b>Diversity</b>: we seek the most diverse and inclusive event possible</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>How to apply</h4>

            <p>
              For the fourth time, we are running our Scholarship Program, which provides individuals from
              underrepresented groups with support to attend JSConf EU and CSSconf EU.

              We are very grateful and would like to say a big Thank You to the companies and individuals who donate to
              our Scholarship Program. In 2018, we were able to give away 80 tickets and we hope to be able to invite
              even more people in 2019.

              If you’ve always wanted to visit JSConf and/or CSSconf EU, but haven’t had the money or resources to, this
              is your chance! The Scholarship Program was made for you.

              ❤️ Granting these scholarships is made possible thanks to the wonderful people that buy Diversity Support
              Tickets, as well as the generous contributions made by our sponsors. More help is needed – talk to us if
              you’d like to get involved: scholarship@jsconf.eu.
              Scholarship applications have closed since the 11th of March!
              Voting Process

              Voting happens within a jury of four:

              Olivia Hugger
              Princiya Sequeira
              Simone Haas
              Thuy Le

              Here’s how we select scholarship recipients:

              Anonymize submissions, so we don’t bias against anything related to the submitter
              There are two rounds of voting for each form:
              In the first round, we each review every submission and rate them from 0 to 3
              In the second round, we compare our votes and factor in budget and location
              Finally, we de-anonymize submissions and create a list of people who have been accepted within our budget,
              and a waiting list in case a scholarship recipient can’t make it or our budget increases

              Frequently Asked Questions


              What does the scholarship entail?

              We provide two kinds of scholarships, one with travel grant and one without.


              How long are applications open for and when will I get feedback?

              This depends on whether you need a visa to enter Germany. We have two separate application timelines for
              people who need a visa and people who do not need a visa (i.e. Schengen area residents). The timelines are
              as follows:

              If you need a visa: From 15th of November, 2018 until 30th of January, 2019. Our feedback for this
              application round will be provided by Friday, 22nd February, 2019.
              If you do not need a Visa: From 15th of November, 2018 until 10th of March, 2019. Our feedback for this
              application round will be provided by Friday, April 5, 2019 (postponed from Friday, March 29, 2019).

              Can I apply for a scholarship again if I got one last year?

              For the sake of fairness we don’t give away a scholarship to the same person within 2 years, this means we
              won’t consider anyone who has already received a scholarship for CSSconf/JSConf EU in 2017 and 2018.

              How can I get an invitation letter for my visa?

              Once you get selected for the scholarship, we will send you a form from which we will create an invitation
              letter for visa. This might take some time, so if your country has specific time restrictions on visas,
              please let us know in advance via scholarship@jsconf.eu.
