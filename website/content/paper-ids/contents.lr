body: 

### Introduction
All contributions to ADASS 2020 have been assigned a unique identifier of the
form XT-N, where:

* X is P for posters, O for talks, I for invited talks, B for
BoFs, H for special talks (e.g. the software prize talk) and D for focus demos.
* T is the theme number (1 to 11). Contributions that specified more than one
theme were assigned one specific theme just to make the various themes not too
unbalanced.
* N is just a running number.

For instance, a fantastic PID is O11-35 ;-)

### Themes

* 1: Science Platforms and Data Lakes
* 2: Cloud Computing at Different Scales
* 3: Cross-Discipline Projects
