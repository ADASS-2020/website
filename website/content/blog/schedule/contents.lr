### Full presentation schedule released

We are happy to announce the full schedule is now [available]('/program-schedule') online.

For better orientation, we have grouped the talks and named the sessions accordingly.

We'll guess there is not much more to add, enjoy [browsing]('/program-schedule') and keep in mind,
tickets are almost sold out!
