body: You have a cool thing, that everybody should see? Knowing Javascript will make your life soo much easier. This talk will show you a pythonistas love story with JS and how to build a website with Vue.js
Vue.js is a javascript framework to build beautiful frontends fast. Using it will make building a frontend so much faster, that it is worth learning some javascript for it. I will explain Vue.js from a Django perspective. Also you will be able to play my Vue.js game about birds and Berlin during the talk.
