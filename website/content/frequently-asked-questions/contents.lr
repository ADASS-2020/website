This event, just like all other ADASS conferences over the years, is run by

As for Sunday we will provide one coffee break between tutorial sessions (only for those who registered for the tutorials) and a welcome reception open to all registered participants and their significant others.

We will have vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options for those who specify them at registration time.


<h3 id="program">Program</h3>

#### How will the program look like?

The program will be released sometimes in the fall of 2020. In the mean time, feel free to check out [last edition program](https://www.adass2019.nl/conference-info/program/).

#### What about tutorials?

We do offer tutorials on Sunday. As the program is yet to be released, you can check out [last edition tutorial schedule](https://www.adass2019.nl/conference-info/program/day1/).

#### Lightning Talks

A lightning talk (LT) is a short (three to five minute) presentation of a single slide. The aim of ADASS lightning talks is to offer participants the chance to highlight their poster contribution.

<h3>Social Events</h3>

#### Is the Welcome Reception free?

Yes! All registered participants and their significan others can attend, provided that they manifested their intention to do so at registration time.


#### Is the Conference Dinner free?

No. You need to purchase a dinner ticket for yourself and up to one guest at registration time.

#### Will there be any other social event?

We hope so! We are looking at organising visits to the city and the Alhambra among other activities. Please check this site for updates.


<h3 id="cfp">Call for Proposals</h3>

#### How can I speak at the conference?

The CfP will open sometime in late spring.

#### Is there a support program for speakers?

We do not have an extra support programme for speakers.  
Please apply to the [Financial Aid Programme](/financial-aid/).

#### When will I get notified?

We plan of notifying anybody who submitted a talk proposal of the outcome of the selection process sometimes in late summer. Non accepted oral contribution authors will be given the chance to present a poster instead.


<h3 id="speaking"> Speaking at the conference</h3>

#### How can I edit my speaker profile?

Registration, speaker / participant profile handling etc. is handled by our [technical secretariat](https://eurocongres.es). Please refer to their site for how to edit your profile.

#### How can I edit my proposals?

Abstract submission is handled by our [technical secretariat](https://eurocongres.es). Please refer to their site for how to edit your proposal.

#### Can I add another speaker to my proposal?

Yes, **before the close of the CfP** you may add another speaker to your proposal. 
After the review: No.  
There should be a good reason for having more than one speakers for talks, please state in the notes.  

#### I have submitted a talk, but would like to make some edits after the CfP.

Please feel free to make reasonable edits and improvements to your description any time. Regardless, your talk must not become a different one. Changes are monitored. Please note during review the talks are non-editable, once accepted you may edit again. See "How can I edit my proposals?" above.

#### Presenting at the Conference

We do encourage everyone to use gender neutral language at the conference.  
Please make sure to bring a HDMI adapter with you.

#### Are speakers invited to the conference?

Invited speakers will be provided a complimentary ticket for the conference but we do not cover any travel or accommodation costs.

#### I have updated some information -  but it does not reflect on the website.

We use a static website. All information is coming from the registration database. The website updated approx. once a day. Please be patient.  
Please do not write to help desk to request information changes, it's self-service, thank you.

#### What about internet during my talk?

There will be no guaranteed internet for the talks, try to avoid making your presentation depend on internet connections. Use internet at your own risk. Though we try our best, conference WiFi performance might not meet everyone's expectations.


<h3 id="open-talk-options">Other Options to Present About a Topic</h3>

<h4 id="open-space">BoFs</h4>

Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions are participant-driven conference spaces dedicated to topics of interest to specific communities. BoF organisers are invited to submit a proposal for their BoF session.


<h3 id="tickets">Tickets</h3>

#### What about student tickets?

Students must present a valid student ID at the conference. If you are a student or will be a student while the conference is running you are eligible for one student ticket. In case you are a student now but won't be a student in November we cannot offer you a student ticket. 

#### I'm on a budget and cannot afford a ticket.

Please have a look at our [financial aid and scholarship program](/financial-aid/). 

#### Can I pay ticket by invoice?

No, purchase via the website only, which requires a credit card.

#### The credit card is not working, are there alternative payment methods?

No, we do not offer alternative payment methods. We use [Stripe](https://stripe.com) for processing all credit card payments. Stripe is a well established payment provider.   
If your credit card is not working, please do contact your bank.  
If you do not have a credit card, consider asking a friend with a credit card to help you out. 

#### Where can I find the invoice?

Once the purchase is finished you will receive **an email** from Eurocongres with your invoice.

#### Can I order tickets via purchase orders?

No, tickets are sold exclusively via the website. If you like to see more service consider sponsoring the conference.

#### I sent you a purchase order but never got an answer.

Sorry for this, but we do not accept purchase orders for tickets, please buy via the website.

#### Do you offer discounts for purchasing multiple tickets at once?

No, we do not offer discounts.

#### When are you going to start selling the tickets?

Ticket sales will open sometime in spring. Please check out site for updates.

#### How much are the tickets?

Ticket prices are going to be in line with last edition figures but are not set yet. Please check this site for updates.

#### Ticket prices VAT

All ticket prices include 21% VAT. European regulations define that
conferences are taxable in the country where the conference takes place, so the EU VAT reverse charging mechanism cannot be applied.
However companies can easily apply for a VAT refund from the authorities.

#### Are tickets refundable?

Yes, tickets will be refundable until approximately one month before the conference, no refunds after that date. Administrative fees are, however, never refundable. You may re-assign the ticket to someone else if you cannot make it or donate it to the financial aid programme.
Please [send an email to the organisers](mailto:adass2020@eurocongres.es?Subject=Refund) to request a refund, refunds will be credited to the credit card used for purchase only.

#### How can I change information on my badge?

We will use the information you provided on the registration page for the conference badges. If you want to change what is on your badge, please [contact the LOC](mailto:adass2020@eurocongres.es).

Conference badges will be printed upfront, please make sure all information is in place by then (approximately one month before the conference). Any changes after this date won't reflect on the badges.

#### Do you offer any day-tickets?

No.

#### Do you sell tickets at the conference?

Absolutely not.

#### Are badges transferable?

No, badges are valid for the person the ticket was assigned to only.


<h3 id="sponsoring">Sponsoring</h3>
