#### COVID-19: how will it affect ADASS 2020?

We are living in very strange times. The ADASS organisers care about the safety
and well being of our community more than anything else. For this reason, this
year conference will be held online instead of in-person. We are sad that we
are not going to see each others face-to-face in beautiful Granada. However we
just could not justify exposing our community to unnecessary heath risks.  The
silver lining is that, being ADASS 2020 a virtual meeting with a significantly
reduced registration fees, we might be able to attract folks who might not have
been able to afford the attendance costs otherwise.

#### A virtual conference? How does that work?

We are still figuring it out. The basic idea is to have the usual tutorials,
BoFs, posters and presentations as every other year. How will posters be
presented? How many of them? How many talks and of which format? These are all
open questions at this point. We plan on making some decisions in the coming
weeks. We will update this website accordingly. We will also send out various
updates and announcements to the community. Stay tuned. Of course, if you have
ideas and suggestions, please [send them our way](/contact).

#### Who's behind this conference?

This event, just like all other ADASS conferences over the years, is run by
volunteers contributing their free time. Sponsor companies and institutions
contribute financially and/or work time of their employees. Conference profits
go entirely towards a fund helping cover costs of future ADASS conferences.

#### Visa - I need a visa to go to Spain. Could you please write me an invitation letter?

As the meeting will be held online, there is no visa requirement.


<h3 id="program">Program</h3>

#### How will the program look like?

The program will be released sometimes in the fall of 2020. In the mean time,
feel free to check out 
[last edition program](https://www.adass2019.nl/conference-info/program/).

#### What about tutorials?

We do offer tutorials on Sunday. As the program is yet to be released, you can
check out 
[last edition tutorial schedule](https://www.adass2019.nl/conference-info/program/day1/).

#### Lightning Talks

A lightning talk (LT) is a short (three to five minute) presentation of a
single slide. The aim of ADASS lightning talks is to offer participants the
chance to highlight their poster contribution.

<h3>Social Events</h3>

Sadly, no in-person social events this year. We are looking into organising
some social activities online. Stay tuned.


<h3 id="cfp">Call for Proposals</h3>

#### How can I speak at the conference?

The CfP will open sometime in June/July.

#### Is there a support program for speakers?

We do not have an extra support programme for speakers.  
Please apply to the [Financial Aid Programme](/financial-aid/).

#### When will I get notified?

We plan of notifying anybody who submitted a talk proposal of the outcome of
the selection process sometimes in late summer. Non accepted oral contribution
authors will be given the chance to present a poster instead.


<h3 id="speaking"> Speaking at the conference</h3>

#### How can I edit my speaker profile?

Registration, speaker / participant profile handling etc. is handled by our
[technical secretariat](https://eurocongres.es). Please refer to their site for
how to edit your profile.

#### How can I edit my proposals?

Abstract submission is handled by our 
[technical secretariat](https://eurocongres.es). 
Please refer to their site for how to edit your proposal.

#### Can I add another speaker to my proposal?

Yes, **before the close of the CfP** you may add another speaker to your
proposal.  After the review: No.  There should be a good reason for having more
than one speakers for talks, please state in the notes.  

#### I have submitted a talk, but would like to make some edits after the CfP.

Please feel free to make reasonable edits and improvements to your description
any time. Regardless, your talk must not become a different one. Changes are
monitored. Please note during review the talks are non-editable, once accepted
you may edit again. See "How can I edit my proposals?" above.

#### Presenting at the Conference

We do encourage everyone to use gender neutral language at the conference.  
Please make sure to have a good internet connection to be able to share video
and screen.

#### Are speakers invited to the conference?

Invited speakers will be provided a complimentary ticket for the conference but
we do not cover any travel or accommodation costs.

#### I have updated some information -  but it does not reflect on the website.

We use a static website. All information is coming from the registration
database.  The website updated approximately once a day. Please be patient.
Please do not write to help desk to request information changes, it's
self-service, thank you.


<h3 id="open-talk-options">Other Options to Present About a Topic</h3>

<h4 id="open-space">BoFs</h4>

Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions are participant-driven conference spaces
dedicated to topics of interest to specific communities. BoF organisers are
invited to submit a proposal for their BoF session.


<h3 id="tickets">Tickets</h3>

#### What about student tickets?

Students must present a valid student ID at the conference. If you are a
student or will be a student while the conference is running you are eligible
for one student ticket. In case you are a student now but won't be a student in
November we cannot offer you a student ticket. 

#### I'm on a budget and cannot afford a ticket.

Please have a look at our [financial aid and scholarship program](/financial-aid/). 

#### Can I pay ticket by invoice?

No, purchase via the website only, which requires a credit card.

#### The credit card is not working, are there alternative payment methods?

Yes, we do offer bank transfer as an alternative payment method.  However, if
your credit card is not working, please do contact your bank. This is a
recurring issue with North-American cards when your bank was not notified of a
possible foreign purchase.

#### Where can I find the invoice?

Once the purchase is finished you will receive **an email** from Eurocongres
with your invoice.

#### Can I order tickets via purchase orders?

No, tickets are sold exclusively via the website. If you like to see more
service consider sponsoring the conference.

#### I sent you a purchase order but never got an answer.

Sorry for this, but we do not accept purchase orders for tickets, please buy
via the website.

#### Do you offer discounts for purchasing multiple tickets at once?

No, we do not offer discounts.

#### When are you going to start selling the tickets?

Ticket sales will open sometime in June/July. Please check out site for
updates.

#### How much are the tickets?

Ticket prices will be significantly lower than previous years due to the
conference being held online only. We still have to charge participants to
cover the organisation costs. We are shooting for <100 &#8364; price.

#### Why do I have to pay for an online conference?

We would like to be able to afford making ADASS XXX free. However we simply can't. Here is why:

 * We are paying a technical secretariat to accept and process abstract submissions
 * We are paying for a payment processor (yes, I know)
 * We are paying for logo and general graphic design
 * We are paying for software licenses (Zoom etc.)
 * We are paying for hosting (especially relevant of we end up hosting videos of the talks)

At the same time, by purchasing an ADASS XXX ticket you will be able to attend
a great conference and have access to all of the recorded videos.

#### Ticket prices VAT

All ticket prices include 21% VAT. European regulations define that conferences
are taxable in the country where the conference takes place, so the EU VAT
reverse charging mechanism cannot be applied.  However companies can easily
apply for a VAT refund from the authorities.

#### Are tickets refundable?

Yes, tickets will be refundable until approximately one month before the
conference, no refunds after that date. Administrative fees are, however, never
refundable. You may re-assign the ticket to someone else if you cannot make it
or donate it to the financial aid programme.  Please [send an email to the
organisers](mailto:adass2020@eurocongres.es?Subject=Refund) to request a
refund, refunds will be credited to the credit card used for purchase only.

#### How can I change information on my badge?

There will be no conference badges.

#### Do you offer any day-tickets?

No.

#### Do you sell tickets at the conference?

Absolutely not.


<h3 id="sponsoring">Sponsoring</h3>

#### Do you have extra discount codes for sponsors?

No, we don't offer any extra discount codes.

#### Are sponsors free to set up their own sponsoring booth?

We are looking into this. Right now we have a feeling that sponsor booths do
not really work well in an online format.

#### Sponsoring package prices VAT

All sponsoring package prices are net plus statutory VAT in the amount valid at
the time.

#### Where to send the Merchandise as a Sponsor?

Not applicable this year.
