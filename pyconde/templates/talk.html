            <p>Stefan has been using Python since the beginning of the century and is probably best known as core developer of <a href="http://cython.org">Cython</a> and <a href="http://lxml.de">lxml</a>. He spends his time joyfully writing Python and Cython code and teaching people like you how to make the best out of these tools.

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p><em>Tags:</em> compilation optimisation cython performance</p>
            <p>Think you can benefit from making your Python application run faster? Then come along and learn how to tune your code with Cython.</p>
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p><a href="http://cython.org">Cython</a> is not just a Python compiler or a native code wrapping tool, but also a programming language in its own right that mixes Python with C and C++. The fact that you can simply drop Python code into it and compile it gives a very low entry level into performance optimisation by statically compiling your critical code and then tuning it into fast C to make it run faster.</p>
            <p>In this talk, I will show a few use cases where the compilation of regular Python code leads to faster execution, and present ways how to make the code run much faster.</p>
