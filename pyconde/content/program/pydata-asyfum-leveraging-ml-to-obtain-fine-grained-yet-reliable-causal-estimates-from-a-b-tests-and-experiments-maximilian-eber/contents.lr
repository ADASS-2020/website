body: Randomized experiments (including A/B tests) are simple yet powerful for establishing the causal effects of
different treatments. Pharmaceutical companies use them to establish the effectiveness of medications, governments
use them to evaluate the effectiveness of social programs, and online shops use them to optimize the layout of their
website.

While it is easy to establish the _average_ effect of a treatment, it is notoriously difficult to tease out
which subgroups benefit the most. However, often this is the most relevant question: In medical research, for example,
it is important to find the groups for which a novel drug is most powerful (as well as groups for which it
might be harmful). Similarly, knowing which layout works best for a certain sub-population allows for effective
personalization of apps, websites, and marketing programs. As experimentation is becoming pervasive, it is is crucial
to develop robust tools for establishing fine-grained (yet reliable) treatment effects.

In this talk, I will survey a series of methods for combining experimental data with ML techniques to discover
fine-grained, heterogeneous treatment effects. I will present one particular approach in detail that is based on
repeated sample splitting and provide Python code for replication. The method is general enough for a wide range of
applications and does not rely on a particular type of ML algorithm being used in the prediction stage.
