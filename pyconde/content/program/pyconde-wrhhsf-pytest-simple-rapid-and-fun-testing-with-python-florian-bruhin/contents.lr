Florian Bruhin ("The Compiler") is a long-time contributor and maintainer of
both the pytest framework and various plugins. In 2013, he started the
qutebrowser project, a keyboard-focused web browser based on Python and Qt. In
2015, he discovered pytest - since then, he has given talks and conducted
workshops about pytest at various conferences and companies.

body: The pytest tool presents a rapid and simple way to write tests for your Python
code. This training gives an introduction with exercises to some
distinguishing features. We'll also examine how to run existing non-pytest test
suites and discuss migration strategies. Various plugins which extend pytest's
functionality even further will be introduced.

This is the planned outline:

- (30 minutes) pytest feature walkthrough:
  * Automatic test discovery
  * Assertions without boilerplate via the assert statement
  * Configuration and commandline options
  * Marking and skipping tests
  * Data-driven tests via parametrization
  * Exercises

- (30 minutes) pytest fixture mechanism:
  * Setup and teardown via dependency injection
  * Declaring and using function/module/session scoped fixtures
  * Using fixtures from fixture functions
  * Parametrizing fixtures
  * Looking at useful built-in fixtures (managing temporary files, patching, output capturing)
  * Exercises

- (15 minutes): Running existing unittest suites with pytest:
  * Discussing advantages and limitations
  * Strategies for migrating to pytest
  * Exercises

- (15 minutes): Useful third-party plugins:
  * Coverage integration
  * Property-based testing (automated testcase generation) via Hypothesis

Basic Python OOP knowledge (e.g. what a class/instance is) is required.
