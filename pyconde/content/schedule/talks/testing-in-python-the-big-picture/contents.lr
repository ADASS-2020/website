I'm a Python backend developer and maintainer of the [coala](https://coala.io) project. I'm passionate about automated testing and test driven development.

I love to go to conferences and get to know as many people as I can. When away from the computer, I like to go hiking or visit concerts.

## Abstract

*Tags:* tdd best-practice pytest unit-tests testing python

Everybody talks about testing, but not everyone know it inside-out.
In this talk I will paint the big picture of testing in Python. We will talk about test runners, testing strategies, tools to make life easier and finally touch on some more exotic concepts.


## Description
Automated testing is considered an industry standard in software development and yet we see people struggle with it time and time again.
In this talk I will paint the big picture of testing in Python. By the end of it I hope everyone - beginner or veteran - will have learned something new and have a more complete picture.

Topics include:

### Testrunners

I'm not gonna lie to you, I'm a fan of pytest and will be talking mostly about it. It is widely used and makes it very easy for developers to get started with unit testing. But underneath the lean surface lie powerful tools like fixtures, parametrization and plugins, which I will all cover in this talk.

### Strategies

Test driven development (tdd) is a term many have heard, but few have learned to embrace. I will try to make a compelling argument for tdd and show how it can make your life easier. Another concept I want to touch on is continuous integration (CI) as tests are better the more often they are run, so best run them all the time.

### Best Practices

What do I test in which kind of tests? How do I structure my test suite?  How do i make sure I have tested everything? I will try to answer questions like these in the best practices section.

### Tools

Testing is only effective if the cost of writing, running and maintaining tests is very small. That's why I want to look at some nice tools that make testing a breeze for developers. These tools include `mock`, `Faker`, `factory_boy` and a couple more.

### ... and Beyond 

A program is only as good as it's test suite, but how do I make sure my tests are actually good? We'll take a look at mutation testing and find out if we can use it to test our tests. I would also like to touch on the basics of quality assurance and non-automated testing.
